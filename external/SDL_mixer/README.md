# SDL_mixer 3.0

The latest version of this library is available from GitHub:
https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_mixer/releases

SDL_mixer 3.0 ("SDL3_mixer") is an audio management library. It provides
decoding of many popular audio file formats, mixing, various DSP processing
effects and positional audio.

Audio data can be preloaded, or streamed on-the-fly into the mixer.

SDL3_mixer supports multiple audio devices, and can even mix to a memory buffer
instead of feeding audio hardware in real time.

SDL3_mixer is a complete redesign, rewritten almost from scratch to address
deficiencies in SDL2_mixer. The API is completely different and, in our
opinion, a significant improvement in power and ease of use. Please refer to
docs/README-migration.md for details on how to migrate your program to the new
API.

This library is under the zlib license, see the file LICENSE.txt for details.
